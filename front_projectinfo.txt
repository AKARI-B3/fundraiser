<h3>Projects this fundraiser also supports:</h3>

<b>AKARI-PAY + AKARI-PAY Advanced</b><br>
AKARI-PAY is what is powering this fundraiser. Anyone can now set up a payment page that works across multiple devices. This increases donation success rates. Now you can easily create your own Donate button or Payment button to accept Bitcoin Cash payments from your website or blog by linking to a simple one-file html.
<br><br>
AKARI-PAY Advanced has additional features such as color themes, goal bars, multiple goals, fund titles, and feedback after successful donations. We are working on making AKARI-PAY Advanced integrate smoothly with AKARI-PAGES to make setting up your own fundraisers as easy as possible.
<br><br>
<b>AKARI-PAGES</b><br>
AKARI-PAGES is a static HTML+Javascript Fundraiser Website (like the one you are reading right now) that makes it possible for anyone to host for free an informative page that leverages 'AKARI-PAY Advanced' to offer successful fundraising campaigns using Bitcoin Cash.
<br><br>
<b>Further maintenance of Devs.Cash</b><br>
<a target="nw" href="http://devs.cash">http://devs.cash</a> is frequently updated listing of many of the happenings in the development side of the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem focusing mainly on Web Apps, and iPhone/Android Applications. The goal of the project is to highlight and support development projects in the Bitcoin Cash Developer Ecosystem. By increasing the network effect we see the value of Bitcoin Cash increasing helping more individuals reach better financial positions.
